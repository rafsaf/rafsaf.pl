## rafsaf.pl

**https://rafsaf.pl**

This is small project of my portfolio currently hosted on GH-Pages (in the past on Netlify for a 2 years or so). Written in Next.js, although branch with legacy Gatsby.js code can still be found https://github.com/rafsaf/rafsaf.pl/tree/old-gatsby-version.

Why? Because I felt like it.

PS. If you dig in git history, some old hardcoded credencials to https://prismic.io CMS could be found. Feel free to use them to hack me.

## Older version

Pure React but very poor quality oldest version of rafsaf.pl is archived here https://github.com/rafsaf/portfolio.
