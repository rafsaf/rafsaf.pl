## rafsaf.pl

**https://rafsaf.pl**

This is small project of my portfolio currently hosted on GH-Pages (in the past on Netlify for a 2 years or so). Written in Next.js, although branch with legacy Gatsby.js code can still be found https://github.com/rafsaf/rafsaf.pl/tree/old-gatsby-version.

Why? Because I felt like it.

PS. If you dig in git history, some old hardcoded credencials to https://prismic.io CMS could be found. Feel free to use them to hack me.

## Older version

Pure React but very poor quality oldest version of rafsaf.pl is archived here https://github.com/rafsaf/portfolio.

## 2025 update

I am so so sick after **another** major release of **another** JS framework where you can basically throw away 50% of your code trying to figure out **new, better way to do this**. I've been using few frameworks here in past few years, now and on this site will be pure JS stuff with some jinja templates extras. Bye bye JS frameworks. Imagine having site that is not throwing 5000 errors on npm update. Oh sorry, yarn. Ops, pnpm. Nooo, bun. Or maybe already something else more shiny pop up yesterday?
