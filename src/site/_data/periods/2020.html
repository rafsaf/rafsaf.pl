<h2>2020</h2>
<h4>09-12</h4>
<p>In September 2020 I started learning <code>React.js</code> and <code>Javascript</code>, building some simple applications and my first portfolio (in pure React together with simple api in <code>Django REST framework</code> as a CMS, deplyed via github pages).</p>
<p>Then, from the end of the year, I became interested in <code>Gatsby.js</code> and Headless CMS.</p>
<h4>01-08</h4>
<p>For the first half of a year, I focused mainly on developing in <code>Python</code> programming, more specifically creating web applications in <code>Django</code>. I have always used Github in my projects since spring 2020. Due to the success of my <code>Django</code> project for a browser game, I kept developing it until around February 2021 due to the huge interest among the community.</p>
