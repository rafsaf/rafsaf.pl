# Professional career

As for programming languages, I mostly write in Python (since 2019) and Go (since 2023). I'm a reliable, patient, precise, and quite talented engineer with a good memory and social skills.

Usually, in every team I work with, I take on as much DevOps work as possible simply because I enjoy it (Ansible, Kubernetes, CI/CD, VM/firewall settings, logs/metrics/dashboards/monitoring/secrets management, just to name a few). I love maintaining large tech infrastructure, from older VM-based or even bare-metal stacks to Kubernetes, either on the cloud or self-hosted. I know, have tried, or at least have heard of probably every software/cloud provider/solution out there.
