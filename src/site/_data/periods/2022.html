<h1 id="2022">2022</h1>
<p>For 1-2 months I was introduced to every detail of <strong>Samsung Global Goals Server</strong> application (Python, Django, GCP cloud). It's a <strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/samsung-global-goals/">big charity project</a></strong>, with android app preinstalled on every Samsung phone for a few years now, with thousands of reqps traffic and over 100 milions of users all over the world and 91 languages support. Then in next months I became core dev, person responsible for every of 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0 SGG server releases in 2022. It involved whole process from coming up with solutions (the best part) how to implement features and improvements, planning the work, writting a code and tests, testing on stage envs and releasing. On daily basis I've been working with only one another developer, senior collegue before spring 2022, then regular developer in whose recruitment process I participated and then mentored in onboarding process and later.</p>
