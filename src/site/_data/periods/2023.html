<h1>2023</h1>
<p>From March 2023 - transition to the position of Senior Software Engineer. I spent this year as a tech lead in the SGG server project (see 2022). As a result, I had a lot more "management" responsibilities (maybe even more than I would have liked), planning, creating and updating tickets, making technical decisions, how to implement things. I've worked with 2 fantastic developers on the team, so it's clear that I've learned a lot. I didn't stop there - I recreated my home lab with <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox VE</a>, now having a 2-node cluster with multiple VMs and a Kubernetes cluster:p The big change was improving my experience with OpenTofu (Terraform) and learning Ansible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I experienced 2 weeks in the Alps on via ferrata roads and ran in 3 half marathons - in Warsaw, Wroclaw, Krakow, with the best time of 1:48:28.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<p>– Bringing Pgbouncer connection pooling software to enterprise-sized production servers with PostgreSQL database with RO replicas</p>
<p>– Learn Ansible, use it both at work and in private home lab</p>
<p>– Create Backuper, open-source software for backing up popular databases</p>
<p>– Going through a full security audit of enterprise server infrastructure</p>
<p>– Learn the (basics of) Go and contribute to Proxmox TF provider</p>
