<h1 id="2024">2024</h1>
<p><strong>Jan. - Feb.</strong></p>
<p>Worked at Samsung until the end of February.</p>
<p><strong>Mar. - Dec.</strong></p>
<p>Started at Opera Software on March 18. At Opera, I worked in the Mobile Services team that delivers backend infrastructure mainly for Opera Mini and Opera for Android mobile apps. That team maintains many services, all of which include monitoring/alerting infrastructure. Since some parts of it are under SOX, I probably can't write much about what exactly I do there.</p>
<p>But, on a daily basis, we work with Python/Django for two CMS, Go for web APIs, and Vue for one larger frontend project we maintain.</p>
<p>Opera has such a cool in-house setup that I really love. We have our own OpenStack data centers in Europe, the USA, and Asia. Custom CA authorities, a team responsible for company-wide Kubernetes, required U2F keys, and good and reasonable security standards (this is quite different from what I saw at Samsung), along with many custom tools and software.</p>
<p><strong>Some highlights for that year:</strong></p>
<p>– Django and Python</p>
<p>– A lot of (quite difficult) Go writing, notification-sending system based on Temporal</p>
<p>– Avro logs for BQ usage, one of the key points is how not to lose them</p>
<p>– OpenTofu adoption instead of Terraform and CI/CD for it</p>
<p>– Kubernetes!!! PostgreSQL operators, Helm, and more Helm, CI/CD again, Vault for secrets, migrations from VM to K8s</p>
<p>– A lot, a lot of Ansible, networking, OpenStack for some older projects, Debian upgrades</p>
<p>– Grafana and the whole stack alongside (Prometheus/Blackbox Exporter/PostgreSQL database, etc.) migration</p>
<p>– Two marathons: one in Kraków in April and the other in December in Valencia.</p>
