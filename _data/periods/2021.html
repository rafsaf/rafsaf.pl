<h1>2021</h1>
<p><strong>Nov. - Dec.</strong></p>
<p>I have been working as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&amp;D since the beginning of November. On my first month I was helping frontend team with React <strong><a href="https://pwa.samsungglobalgoals.com">PWA application</a></strong>, but since December, I naturally got involved in backend of Samsung Global Goals charity project.</p>
<p><strong>Jul. - Oct.</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of July this year, I started working at Nokia in Wroc≈Çaw as a <code>Python</code> developer working student in the BOAM Arch department as a developer to maintain the infrastructure of scripts automating <code>JIRA</code> (mainly via Gitlab jobs) and several projects written in <code>Django</code> and hosted using <code>Docker swarm</code>. There I used technologies such as <code>Python</code>, <code>Django</code>, <code>Gitlab-CI</code>, <code>Docker</code>, <code>Kubernetes</code>, <code>JIRA</code>. Meanwhile I continued to write new projects on my <code>Github</code>, mainly <code>FastAPI</code> stuff but also maintanance of plemiona-planer.pl.</p>
<p><strong>Jan. - Jun.</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of the year, after completing the application in <code>Django</code> and introducing a paid subscription for the project, I started developing in the field of building static web applications as a front developer, deepening my knowledge in the field of <code>CSS</code> and modern <code>JS</code> apps (I fell in love with framework <code>Gatsby.js</code> together with Headless CMS). I have completed several courses on the udemy platform in the fields of <code>CSS</code>, <code>Gatsby</code> and <code>CSS</code> in <code>JS</code> movment which i really love (styled components library), well actually this site uses styled components, as well as <code>Gatsby</code> and great site prismic.io as a Headless CMS. At the end of this period, I switched from <code>JS</code> to <code>Typescript</code>.</p>
<p>From around March-April, I took seriously learning docker and docker-compose and development towards the backend, from the side of code writing to the production environment. I chose the popular and very modern <code>FastAPI</code> framework, which naturally supports typing in <code>Python</code> and <code>Docker</code>.</p>
