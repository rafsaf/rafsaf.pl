# 2020

**Sep. - Dec.**

In September 2020 I started learning `React.js` and `Javascript`, building some simple applications and my first portfolio (in pure React together with simple api in `Django REST framework` as a CMS, deplyed via github pages).

Then, from the end of the year, I became interested in `Gatsby.js` and Headless CMS.

**Jan. - Aug.**

For the first half of a year, I focused mainly on developing in `Python` programming, more specifically creating web applications in `Django`. I have always used Github in my projects since spring 2020. Due to the success of my `Django` project for a browser game, I kept developing it until around February 2021 due to the huge interest among the community.
