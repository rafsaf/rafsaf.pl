# 2024

**Jan. - Feb.**

Work at Samsung until the end of February.

**Mar. - Dec.**

Start at Opera Software on March 18. In Opera, I was working in Mobile Services team that delivers backend infrastructure mainly for Opera Mini and Opera for Android mobile apps. That team maintain many services. All of that includes monitoring/alerting infrastructure. Since some part of it is under SOX, probably i cannot write a lot what exactly I do there.

But..., on a daily basic, we work in Python/Django for two CMS, Go for web APIs, Vue for one bigger frontend project we maintain.

Opera has such a cool in-house setup that I really love. We have own Open Stack datacenters in Europe, USA, Asia. Custom CA authorities, team responsible for company-wide k8s, required U2f keys, good and reasonable security standards (this is quite different from what I saw in Samsung), many own tools and software.

**Some highlights for that year:**

– Django and Python

– So much (quite difficult) Go writting, notification sending system based on temporal

– Avro logs for BQ usage, one of key points is how no to loose them

– OpenTofu adoption instead of tf and CI/CD for it

– Kubernetes!!! postgres operators, helm and more of helm, CI/CD again, Vault for secrets, migrations from VM to K8s

– A lot, a lot of ansible, networking, open stack for some older projects, debian upgrades

– Grafana and whole stack alongside (prometheus/blackbox exporter/pg database etc) migration

– Two marathons, one in Kraków on April then again on December in Valencia
