# 2023

From March 2023 - transition to the position of Senior Software Engineer. I spent this year as a tech lead in the SGG server project (see 2022). As a result, I had a lot more "management" responsibilities (maybe even more than I would have liked), planning, creating and updating tickets, making technical decisions, how to implement things. I've worked with 2 fantastic developers on the team, so it's clear that I've learned a lot. I didn't stop there - I recreated my home lab with [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview), now having a 2-node cluster with multiple VMs and a Kubernetes cluster:p The big change was improving my experience with OpenTofu (Terraform) and learning Ansible.

On the other hand, I experienced 2 weeks in the Alps on via ferrata roads and ran in 3 half marathons - in Warsaw, Wroclaw, Krakow, with the best time of 1:48:28.

**Highlights:**

– Bringing Pgbouncer connection pooling software to enterprise-sized production servers with PostgreSQL database with RO replicas

– Learn Ansible, use it both at work and in private home lab

– Create Backuper, open-source software for backing up popular databases

– Going through a full security audit of enterprise server infrastructure

– Learn the (basics of) Go and contribute to Proxmox TF provider
