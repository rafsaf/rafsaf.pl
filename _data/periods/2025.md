# 2025

**Some highlights for that year:**

– Even more `Go`.

– Moving VMs based production `Go` service to the dual region k8s behind GeoDNS (without downtime).

– Not often happening, but we had an opportunity to write a new project and choose a tech stack, we chose FastAPI and Vue.

– For a few months I led the work to move legacy Pike language (yes, Pike) configurations of Opera Mini and Opera for Android mobile apps to a new system with full backward compatibility and compilation back to Pike. Step by step and thanks to amazing people in all involved teams we were able to actually finish the first, most important phase.

– Some features to other Vue + Django project related to push notifications, FCM etc.

– In my homelab, a lot happened: a new (not quite, of course) Dell R740 server with finally enterprise-grade components and a lot of tasks I had in mind related to this, mostly Ansible, OpenTofu setups, backups and automations, also brand new services.

– I even touched Opera Mini code for the first time, yes Java.

– Last but not least, Opera 30-year birthday party in Italy.
