I have quite big experience working with postgresql databases
as a user. In samsung our app was running using enterprise size
PG database with 3 RO replicas, the issues that happen at that scale
are different story from "normal" usage people perform. Moreover,
at a time i wrote "ogion" that supports dump for most popular
dbs: mariadb, postgres, mysql.
