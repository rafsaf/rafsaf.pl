I have been working as a Software Engineer at Samsung R&D since the beginning of November. On my first month I was helping frontend team with React **[PWA application](https://pwa.samsungglobalgoals.com)**, but since December, I naturally got involved in backend of Samsung Global Goals charity project.

From the beginning of July this year, I started working at Nokia in Wroc≈Çaw as a `Python` developer working student in the BOAM Arch department as a developer to maintain the infrastructure of scripts automating `JIRA` (mainly via Gitlab jobs) and several projects written in `Django` and hosted using `Docker swarm`. There I used technologies such as `Python`, `Django`, `Gitlab-CI`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `JIRA`. Meanwhile I continued to write new projects on my `Github`, mainly `FastAPI` stuff but also maintanance of plemiona-planer.pl.

From around March-April, I took seriously learning docker and docker-compose and development towards the backend, from the side of code writing to the production environment. I chose the popular and very modern `FastAPI` framework, which naturally supports typing in `Python` and `Docker`.

From the beginning of the year, after completing the application in `Django` and introducing a paid subscription for the project, I started developing in the field of building static web applications as a front developer, deepening my knowledge in the field of `CSS` and modern `JS` apps (I fell in love with framework `Gatsby.js` together with Headless CMS). I have completed several courses on the udemy platform in the fields of `CSS`, `Gatsby` and `CSS` in `JS` movment which i really love (styled components library), well actually this site uses styled components, as well as `Gatsby` and great site prismic.io as a Headless CMS. At the end of this period, I switched from `JS` to `Typescript`.
